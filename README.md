The word of the day
how would one know they exist
if they only live it their place
They are there within that spot
but live only with one pot
They act as though its solitaire
without seeing any care
What would know how it matters
a crack here and there
and see spring or tatter
and know if somethings there
To know one exists
to know ones there
How to know if anyones there
is to know thyself
to know what it really means
to be a moving being
not just hangin on a string
